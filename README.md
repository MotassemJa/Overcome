# Overcome - Phase 1
Overcome is a project aiming to help children with autism to learn about feelings.
Users of the app could be classified under one of the following roles:
  - Parent
  - Child

A user with parent role will be able to define new feelings or manage old ones. On the other hand, a user with a child role will consume those feelings.
Each feeling to be added should contain a name, voice description (**TODO**), and a picture showing the feeling. **The picture could be a family member expressing the exact feeling**.

After defining feelings by the parents, a child can start the practice. The process will go through 3 diffirent levels:

  - Get to Know: In this level, the child will learn about the feelings defined by the parents. A list will pop up on the screen and play each feeling's voice descriotion along side with the image.
  - Match the feeling: In the second level, the child will be shown diffirent pictures, and only one of those pictures matches the feeling to be choosen.
  - Find the feeling (**TODO**): The coolset level of the app! With the help of beacons, a family member will hold a beacon and express a feeling, while the child will be asked to find the family member expressing that feeling. An indoor map will be shown with beacon's location highlighted for easier navigation for the child.

The app requires no internet connection to allow users to add pictures of their own without any privacy concerns.
